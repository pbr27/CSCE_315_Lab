    <p style="font-weight: bold;">1. Keep Earth Cool</p>
    A small project I worked with 4 others on when I attended Girls Who Code in 2017, a summer immersion program for
    rising junior and senior high school girls to close the gender gap in computer science. The project featured a website created with HTML and CSS and a mini game made with Scratch to educate and raise awareness on climate change.

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">2. Detail For Retail</p>
    A project I worked on with 4 others when I took CSCE 310 (Database Systems) over the summer. The purpose of this project was to
    create a system to manage retail stores and their business-to-business transactions in an efficient manner. Our backend was done with Python (Bootstrap) and
    our frontend was done using HTML. We implemented SQLAlchemy to store information in our databases for our entities.
