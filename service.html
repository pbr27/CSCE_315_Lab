<h1>Service</h1>
<div>
    While I have not done much as of now to give back to my community, I definitely plan to change this in the future. <br>
    <br>
    One cause that I am extremely passionate about is feminism or any feminist movement to empower women and girls all over the world.
    As a woman in computer science, a heavily male dominated field, I would like to advocate for change so that we can work even further towards closing
    the gender gap in the field. <br>
    <br>
    In the meantime, all I can do right now is work on myself and better my skills so that I can be better equipped to give back in the future.
